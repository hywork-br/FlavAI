## Helps you ship faster

FlavAI uses Large Language Models to review code in your CI/CD pipeline. It should pick up on common issues such as:

- Exposed secrets
- Slow or inefficient code
- Potential bugs or unhandled edge cases

It can also be run locally in your command line to review staged files.

```bash
npx FlavAI review
```

## Demo

## Ethos üí≠

- Beautiful CLI tool written in typescript and bun
- Vertically integrated into your CI/CD pipeline
- Functions as a human code reviewer, using a small set of optimised tools
- Acts as a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) client for integration with external tools such as browser use, infrastructure deployments, observability monitoring.

## Setup Instructions üí´

See the [setup instructions](docs/setup.md) for more docs on how to set up FlavAI in your CI/CD pipeline and use it locally.

## Development üîß

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/mattzcarey/FlavAI.git
   cd FlavAI
   ```

2. Install dependencies (we use bun but you can use npm or pnpm if you prefer):

   ```shell
   bun i
   ```

3. Set up the API key:
   - Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
   - Open the `.env` file and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OPENAI API key.

4. Run the application:

```shell
bun start
```

See the package.json file for all the npm commands you can run.

5. Make a PR üéâ

We use [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) on this project. If you want to create a new release from your PR, please make sure your PR title follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format. The release-please bot will automatically create a new release for you when your PR is merged.

- fix: which represents bug fixes, and correlates to a patch version.
- feat: which represents a new feature, and correlates to a SemVer minor.
- feat!:, or fix!:, refactor!:, etc., which represent a breaking change (indicated by the !) and will result in a major version.
